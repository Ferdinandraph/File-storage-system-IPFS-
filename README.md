A decentralized file storage system using Pinata and IPFS, designed to securely manage files in a distributed network. This system allows users to upload files, which are then stored on IPFS, a decentralized storage network. Each file receives a unique Content Identifier (CID), making it easy to retrieve and manage.

Key features include:
User Authentication: Only registered users can upload files and access stored data. A secure login system ensures that all user data is protected.
Decentralized Storage: Files are uploaded via Pinata to IPFS, ensuring they are stored in a decentralized, resilient network.
File Management: Once uploaded, users can retrieve their CIDs, allowing them to access or share their files at any time.
This system is ideal for anyone looking to leverage the benefits of decentralized storage, providing privacy, security, and independence from traditional, centralized platforms.
